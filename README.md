## Introduction

This repository includes machine learning models and projects that I developed during my internship at CodSoft. Each project is organized in its own directory with relevant code.

## Projects

### Task 1: Movie Genre Prediction

- **Description:** Created a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information.
- **Techniques Used:** TF-IDF
- **Classifiers:** Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression
- **Directory:** `Movie Genre Classification`
- **Dataset:** Movie Genre Dataset

### Task 2: Fraudulent Credit Card Transaction Detection

- **Description:** Built a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing transaction information.
- **Techniques Used:** Decision Trees
- **Directory:** `Credit Card Fraud Detection`
- **Dataset:** Credit Card Fraud Dataset

### Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction

- **Description:** Developed a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business using historical customer data, including usage behavior and demographics.
- **Techniques Used:** Gradient Boosting
- **Directory:** `Customer Churn Prediction`
- **Dataset:** Customer Churn Dataset

### Task 4: SMS Spam Classification

- **Description:** Built an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate using techniques like TF-IDF with the Naive Bayes classifier.
- **Techniques Used:** TF-IDF
- **Classifiers:** Naive Bayes
- **Directory:** `Spam SMS Detection`
- **Dataset:** SMS Spam Dataset
